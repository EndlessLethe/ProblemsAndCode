# In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
#
# The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive).
# The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search,
# the computer will guess the user's secret number!
#
# Here is a transcript of an example session:
#
# Please think of a number between 0 and 100!
# Is your secret number 50?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
# Is your secret number 75?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
# Is your secret number 87?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
# Is your secret number 81?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
# Is your secret number 84?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. h
# Is your secret number 82?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. l
# Is your secret number 83?
# Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly. c
# Game over. Your secret number was: 83
# Your program should use bisection search. So think carefully what that means. What will the first guess always be? How should you calculate subsequent guesses?
